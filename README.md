# CO2-Prediction-ML-vs-Regression
Comparative analysis of machine learning and regression models for predicting CO₂ emissions using data science techniques.

#OVERVIEW
This project aims to predict CO₂ emissions using various machine learning models and compare their performances. It includes both regression models (like Ridge Regression) and non-regression ML models (like Random Forest, SVR, and Gradient Boosting).

The goal is to understand which models are more effective in predicting emissions and what insights can be drawn from the features used.

#OBJECTIVES
-Analyze the relationship between vehicle-related features and CO₂ emissions.
-Apply and compare multiple regression and ML models.
-Evaluate models using performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²).
-Visualize the actual vs predicted emissions.

#Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Features: Engine size, fuel consumption, cylinders, fuel type, etc.
Target: CO₂ Emissions (in g/km)
